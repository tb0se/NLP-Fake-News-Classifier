# COMS4045A NLP - Project: South African Fake news classifier

## Dataset

* The fake news are from [South African Disiniformation website data -2020](https://zenodo.org/record/4682843).
* The real news were scraped by me from [News24](https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica).

I then merged the two datasets and shuffled them to create a dataset that I can use to train my classifier models.
